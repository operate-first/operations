# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Support

This repository contains all the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) principles and guidelines for managing the [Operate  First](https://operate-first.github.io/) services.

## What is SRE?

SRE is a software engineering approach to manage operations for systems, applications and services. We use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks.
